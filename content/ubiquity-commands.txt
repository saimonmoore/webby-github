h2(title). Ubiquity Commands

Here's where I collect all the various commands I write for "Mozilla Ubiquity":http://ubiquity.mozilla.com/, a really cool extension for Firefox. If you don't use Firefox, you should probably "get it now":http://www.firefox.com. If you want to, you can also subscribe to this page using Ubiquity and keep up to date with all my commands. I won't try to do anything fishy with your computer, I promise! You can even look at the "source code":/ubiquity/commands.js of my command feed to see what you're getting.
