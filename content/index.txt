<h2 class="page_title">Welcome</h2>

<p>
	I&#8217;m a fledgling programmer/web developer from historic <a href="http://www.chesternj.org/">Chester, New Jersey</a>. I work for an Ã¼ber cool company called <a href="http://www.fifthroomcreative.com">Fifth Room Creative</a>, located in Denville, NJ. We do some pretty awesome stuff for clients ranging from Panasonic all the way down to local small businesses.
</p>
<p>
	I realy love what I do, and I have a constant desire to learn new things. For better or for worse, I&#8217;m constantly creating my own custom solutions to problems I encounter at work, and I&#8217;ve decided to share them here on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> so that I can learn from people with more experience than me. I&#8217;d like to thank the developers behind GitHub for creating a place where people like me can learn from seasoned developers and exchange ideas with their peers.
