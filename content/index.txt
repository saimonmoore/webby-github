h2(page_title). Welcome

I'm a fledgling programmer/web developer from historic "Chester, New Jersey":http://www.chesternj.org/. I work for an Ã¼ber cool company called "Fifth Room Creative":http://www.fifthroomcreative.com, located in Denville, NJ. We do some pretty awesome stuff for clients ranging from Panasonic all the way down to local small businesses.

I realy love what I do, and I have a constant desire to learn new things. For better or for worse, I'm constantly creating my own custom solutions to problems I encounter at work, and I've decided to share them here on "GitHub":http://github.com so that I can learn from people with more experience than me. I'd like to thank the developers behind GitHub for creating a place where people like me can learn from seasoned developers and exchange ideas with their peers.

h2. Blog

<%
	posts = @pages.find(:all, :in_directory => "blog", :recursive => true, :sort_by => "created_at", :reverse => true)
	posts.delete_if {|post| post.url =~ }
	paginate(posts, 3) do |post|
-%>

h3(post_title). <%= post.title %>

_<%= post.created_at %>_

<%= render(post) %>

<% end -%>

<%= link_to("previous", @pager.prev) if @pager.prev? %>
<%= link_to("next", @pager.next) if @pager.next? %>
