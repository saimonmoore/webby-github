h2(page_title). Welcome

I'm a fledgling programmer/web developer from historic "Chester, New Jersey":http://www.chesternj.org/. I work for an Ã¼ber cool company called "Fifth Room Creative":http://www.fifthroomcreative.com, located in Denville, NJ. We do some pretty awesome stuff for clients ranging from Panasonic all the way down to local small businesses.

I realy love what I do, and I have a constant desire to learn new things. For better or for worse, I'm constantly creating my own custom solutions to problems I encounter at work, and I've decided to share them here on "GitHub":http://github.com so that I can learn from people with more experience than me. I'd like to thank the developers behind GitHub for creating a place where people like me can learn from seasoned developers and exchange ideas with their peers.

This site is managed by "Webby":http://webby.rubyforge.org, a content management system that uses ERB and Textile to output static files. Once I make changes to the site I run

<pre>
	$ webby
	$ git add .
	$ git commit -m "commit message describing the changes I just made"
</pre>

From there I setup a @post-commit@ hook that synchronizes Webby's @output/@ directory with a repository linked to "http://github.com/mikedamage/mikedamage.github.com.git":http://github.com/mikedamage/mikedamage.github.com/tree/master. That same script automatically makes a commit to that repository and pushes the changes up to GitHub. And there you have it -- my static CMS.
