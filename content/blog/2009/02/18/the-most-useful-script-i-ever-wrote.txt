h2(post_title). The Most Useful Script I Ever Wrote

Let me cut to the chase. By far, the most useful script I ever wrote is a @man@ page lookup script that works as a "Quicksilver":http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/what_is_quicksilver action.

If you're not in the know (i.e. if you don't use one of the *NIX operating systems like Linux or Mac OS X), @man@ is a command line utility that finds, formats, and displays documentation for just about any installed command line program on your system. It's something I refer to several times every day and it's saved my ass more than once. Utilities like @grep@, @curl@, and the dreaded @sed@ are hard to totally memorize, so @man@ comes in really handy when I'm writing shell scripts or looking for stuff inside of files, not to mention using Git. All of Git's help documentation is contained in handy @man@ pages that get displayed whenever you type @git help [COMMAND]@.

Anyway, I setup a trigger to open Quicksilver in text entry mode whenever I hit CTRL-ALT-M, then whatever I type is piped into the man page looker-upper. When I hit enter, it looks up the man page, strips out the old-school UNIX terminal formatting, saves the result to a file to save time on repeat lookups, and finally displays it in a QuickLook window using @qlmanage@. Here's the code:

You can also "download this script":/scripts/LookupManPage.scpt as an Apple Script Editor file.

<% uv(:lang => 'applescript', :line_numbers => true, :theme => 'sunburst') do %>
using terms from application "Quicksilver"
	on process text theString
		(* CHANGE THESE 2 VARIBALES TO SUIT YOUR FANCY: *)
		set manFile to "/users/mike/documents/manpages/" & theString & ".txt"
		set manDir to "/users/mike/documents/manpages/"
		
		tell application "Finder"
			if exists file manFile then
				do shell script "qlmanage -p " & manFile
			else
				try
					do shell script "man " & theString
				on error
					display dialog "No Manual Entry For " & theString
					return
				end try
				do shell script "man " & theString & " | col -b >> " & manFile & " && qlmanage -p " & manFile
			end if
		end tell
	end process text
end using terms from
<% end %>

After customizing the paths in the script, drop it into @~/Library/Application Support/Quicksilver/Actions/@. It's now available as an action to Quicksilver. To use it, either do what I did and setup a trigger to go directly to it, or hit your QS shortcut (usually CTRL-Space), hit the period key (".") to enter text entry mode, type the name of a command, hit Tab, and start typing "Lookup...". Quicksilver should find the action you're looking for. Hit Enter and voila! Man page in a QuickLook window. Quick, easy, and convenient.
