h2(post_title). Github Listeners

Lately I've been taking a look at all the cool stuff you can make Github do when it receives a push from your local repository. You can do a lot of stuff right off the bat, without doing any coding of your own, by setting up service hooks in the Admin section of your remote repository. Git itself has this ability baked right in, through the use of *post-receive hooks*, little scripts that get fired off whenever the remote repository receives a push from you.
