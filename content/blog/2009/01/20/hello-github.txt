h2(post_title). Hello, Github!

This is the first post in my brand new Github blog site. I've tried blogging before, but I've never been able to stick to it. Hopefully now that my site is a little experiment in and of itself, I'll keep posting.

I want to thank the people behind Github for giving me (and everybody else) this space to blog about the stuff I'm currently hacking on. Ever since I joined Github, which was right around the time it left private beta, it's been an amazing resource for me. I've had the almost voyeuristic opportunity to watch the development process of some pretty amazing projects. As a newcomer to the world of open source development, It's been amazing to learn by watching the pro's.

I plan to use this space to talk about the things I'm currently learning, random ideas I have in the middle of the night, and whatever else I feel like writing about. I'm not going to assume that anybody (other than me) is actually going to read this blog; but if you do somehow stumble upon it, thanks for reading!
