h2(post_title). Meet Webby

This page (and the site that is being built around it) uses "Webby":http://webby.rubyforge.org, which is a really awesome static website manager that tries to deliver the same functionality as the *V* in Rails’ MVC(Model View Controller) stack. It lets me write my stylesheets in Sass, my page content in Textile, and my page layouts in ERB; all of which I’ve grown to love from learning Rails. As I learn more, I'll be posting quite a bit about Webby because there aren't many other blogs that use it or talk about it.

Two resources I found _extremely_ helpful in creating this blog are:
* "Building Static Websites with Webby":http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2008/08/06 by Mike Clark
* "Top 12 Reasons Webby Makes Me Happy":http://www.locomotivation.com/blog/2008/11/17/webby-makes-me-happy.html by Wynn Netherland at "Locomotivation":http://www.locomotivation.com

As awesome as Webby is, however, there are a couple problems inherent to a static content management system. It means that I can't dynamically handle comments to my blog posts, can't manage my own in-site search engine, and a few other little gotcha's. Luckily, there are other places on the interwebs to procure these services and there are a few fellow Webby bloggers who have solved these problems before I was even aware of their existence. For comments, I created a free account over at "Disqus":http://disqus.com after I saw their comment system on Locomotivation. I'm still not sure if or how I will implement a sitewide search box thingy, but Webby auto-generates monthly and yearly blog post indexes, and Google is probably sufficient for my search box needs.

All in all I'm really happy with the results I've gotten so far from Webby, and I had to do virtually no customization thanks to its templates and command line application. I finally feel like I have a blog that I have full control over!
