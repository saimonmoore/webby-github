I’m still trying to find the best solution for plain-text blogging. This page (and the site that is being built around it) currently uses "Webby":http://webby.rubyforge.org, which is a really awesome static website manager that tries to deliver the same functionality as the *V* in Rails’ MVC(Model View Controller) stack. It lets me write my stylesheets in Sass, my page content in Textile, and my page layouts in ERB; all of which I’ve grown to love from learning Rails. As I learn more, I'll be posting quite a bit about Webby because there aren't many other blogs that use it or talk about it.

Two resources I found _extremely_ helpful in creating this blog are:
* "Building Static Websites with Webby":http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2008/08/06 by Mike Clark
* "Top 12 Reasons Webby Makes Me Happy":http://www.locomotivation.com/blog/2008/11/17/webby-makes-me-happy.html by Wynn Netherland at "Locomotivation":http://www.locomotivation.com
