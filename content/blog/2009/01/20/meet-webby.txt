This site is managed by "Webby":http://webby.rubyforge.org, a content management system that uses ERB and Textile to output static files. Once I make changes to the site I run

<pre>
	$ webby
	$ git add .
	$ git commit -m "commit message describing the changes I just made"
</pre>

From there I setup a @post-commit@ hook that synchronizes Webby's @output/@ directory with a repository linked to "http://github.com/mikedamage/mikedamage.github.com.git":http://github.com/mikedamage/mikedamage.github.com/tree/master. That same script automatically makes a commit to that repository and pushes the changes up to GitHub. And there you have it -- my static CMS.
