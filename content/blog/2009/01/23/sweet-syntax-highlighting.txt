h2(post_title). Sweet Syntax Highlighting

I like the idea of using Github "gists":http://gist.github.com to embed code examples in my blog. This way the code lives up on the Github servers and I can revise it independently of the blog post it's included in. It makes it much easier to share code snippets. But I do find their syntax highlighting a little lacking...

So this post is a little experiment in using the "Ultraviolet":http://ultraviolet.rubyforge.org syntax highlighting gem instead. Ultraviolet, in conjunction with "Textpow":http://textpow.rubyforge.org, lets me use my themes from "TextMate":http://macromates.com, which is totally my editor of choice when I'm on my Mac. _(Everywhere else it's the venerable old "Vim":http://www.vim.org, which deserves its own blog post)_.

So here's a code snippet highlighted using the _Sunburst_ theme from TextMate:

<% uv(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => true, :theme => 'sunburst') do -%>
def foo(arg)
  puts "You entered #{arg}."
  puts "That's '#{arg.reverse}' backwards."
end
<% end %>

As you can see, it's a whole lot more vibrant than Github's Gist highlighting, but it's also not as versatile. And, if I want to include line numbers, I can't have them appear in a separate list or table column so that they don't get selected when someone copies the snippet to their clipboard. It's a tradeoff, a classic case of fashion versus function.

Now if there were a way for me to get the best of both worlds, that would be interesting. Maybe I could pull in the content of a Github Gist with some kind of Webby helper method, then run it through Ultraviolet. Hmmm... the wheels are turning... If I find a good way to do this I'll be sure to post it, so stay tuned!
